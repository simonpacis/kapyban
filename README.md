# Kapyban: An AI-Generated Python-Based Kanban Board

Disclaimer: This project has been 95% coded by AI. Including this readme.

## Description

Kapyban is a Python application designed to manage tasks using a Kanban board approach. It provides a simple, text-based interface to create, edit, move, and prioritize tasks organized in columns, mimicking a traditional Kanban board. This tool is ideal for personal task management or small team projects.

## Features

- **Task Management:** Add, edit, remove, and move tasks across different columns.
- **Column Operations:** Create, rename, and destroy columns to customize your board.
- **Prioritization:** Set priorities for tasks (high, medium, low).
- **Deadlines:** Assign deadlines to tasks using natural language.
- **Data Persistence:** Save and load the board state as a JSON file.
- **Command-line Interface:** Easy-to-use commands for managing tasks and columns. No menus in the shape of numbered lists.

## Installation

To use Kapyban, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip3 install dateparser prettytable fuzzywuzzy python-dateutil tabulate rich
```

## Usage

1. **Starting Kapyban:** Run the script to start the application. Optionally, pass a `.json` filename as an argument to load an existing board.

   ```bash
   python3 kapyban.py [filename.json]
   ```

2. **Command List:**
   - General Commands: `help`, `save`, `exit`
   - Board Management: `create <column name>`, `destroy <column name>`, `rename <old column name> <new column name>`
   - Task Management: `add <task description> to <column name>`, `move <task id> <column name>`, `remove <task id>`, `edit <task id> <property> <new value>`, `deadline <task id> <deadline>`, `priority <task id> <priority level>`
   - Output Control: `clear`

3. **Interacting with Kapyban:**
   - Enter commands at the prompt to manage tasks and columns.
   - Use `help` for guidance on command usage.

### Usage Example
### Usage Example for Kapyban

In this example, we'll set up a Kanban board with three columns: "Backlog", "In Progress", and "Completed". We'll add five tasks to different columns, each with a unique ID consisting of a single random letter between 'a' and 'z'. Lastly, we'll move all tasks to the "Completed" column.

1. **Start Kapyban and Create Columns:**
   - Run the Kapyban script.
   - Create three columns:
     ```
     create Backlog
     create In Progress
     create Completed
     ```

2. **Add Tasks to Columns:**
   - Add five tasks with unique IDs. Let's assume the IDs generated by the script for these tasks are 'e', 'r', 't', 'y', 'u'.
     ```
     add Review project requirements to Backlog
     add Set up development environment to In Progress
     add Draft initial design to Backlog
     add Conduct team meeting to In Progress
     add Code review to Backlog
     ```

3. **Move Tasks to 'Completed':**
   - Move all tasks to the "Completed" column:
     ```
     move e Completed
     move r Completed
     move t Completed
     move y Completed
     move u Completed
     ```

After executing these commands, all tasks initially distributed across "Backlog" and "In Progress" will be consolidated under the "Completed" column.
